I am a research associate at the <a href='https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/klinisch_psychologische_intervention/'>Division of Clinical Psychological Intervention, FU Berlin</a> and currently under supervision of Dr. Helen Niemeyer. I am also a member of the <a href='https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/commitments/research-quality/project-list-20/panne/index.html'>PANNE</a> project, which is a collaboration between the FU Berlin and the <a href='https://www.rmz.hu-berlin.de/de/rmz'>Robert K. Merton Center for Science Studies</a> located at HU Berlin.

I am particularly interested in the application of natural language processing methods to clinical psychology and meta-research.
