I am a psychologist (M.Sc.) and research associate at the <a href='https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/klinisch_psychologische_intervention/'>Division of Clinical Psychological Intervention, FU Berlin</a> and currently under supervision of  <a href='https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/klinisch_psychologische_intervention/mitarbeiter/hniemeyer/index.html'>Dr. Helen Niemeyer</a>. My research centers around natural language processing, metascience, and psychotherapy research. I am particularly interested in the development of machine learning methods to improve the estimation of publication bias in the scientific literature.

I am also a member of the <a href='https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/commitments/research-quality/project-list-20/panne/index.html'>PANNE</a> project, which is a collaboration between the FU Berlin and the <a href='https://www.rmz.hu-berlin.de/en/rmz'>Robert K. Merton Center for Science Studies</a> located at HU Berlin. The PANNE research project, led by <a href='https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/klinisch_psychologische_intervention/mitarbeiter/hniemeyer/index.html'>Dr. Helen Niemeyer</a> and <a href='https://www.rmz.hu-berlin.de/en/members/staff/dr-felicitas-hesselmann'>Dr. Felicitas He√üelmann</a>, investigates the relationship between research quality, publishability, reception chances, and academic reputation in academic psychology and history. At the FU Berlin subproject, we use machine learning, behavioral and classical research synthesis methods to investigate academic decision making and the extent of publication bias in the scientific literature.

I earned my MSc in Psychology at the Uni Potsdam in 2023, focusing on machine learning, computational linguistics and psychotherapy research. Previously, I completed my BSc at the Uni Hamburg, specializing in longitudinal data modeling. Furthermore, I received a B.A. in Sociology and Technology Studies with a minor in Human Factors Engineering from the TU Berlin. Throughout my academic journey, I worked as a student research assistant in various research groups across FU Berlin, UKE Hamburg, and TU Berlin.
