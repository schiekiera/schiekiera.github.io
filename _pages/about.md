I am a psychologist (M.Sc.) and research associate at the <a href='https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/klinisch_psychologische_intervention/'>Division of Clinical Psychological Intervention, FU Berlin</a>. My research centers around natural language processing, metascience, and psychotherapy research. I am particularly interested in the development of machine learning methods to improve the estimation of publication bias in the scientific literature.

I am a member of the <a href='https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/commitments/research-quality/project-list-20/panne/index.html'>PANNE</a> project (HU & FU Berlin), which investigates the relationship between research publishability, reception chances, and academic reputation in psychological and historical research using machine learning, behavioral and classical research synthesis methods.

I earned my MSc in Psychology from the Uni Potsdam and my BSc from the Uni Hamburg, specializing in clinical psychology, longitudinal data modeling and machine learning. Furthermore, I received a B.A. in Sociology and Technology Studies with a minor in Human Factors Engineering from the TU Berlin.
