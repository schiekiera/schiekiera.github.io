I am a psychologist (M.Sc.) and research associate in the <a href='https://www.psychology.hu-berlin.de/en/prof/emmy/kompmod/kompmod'> Emmy Noether Junior Research Group Computational Modeling at HU Berlin</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/fritzgntr/home'>Dr. Fritz GÃ¼nther</a>. My research centers around <i>natural language processing</i>, <i>metascience</i>, and <i>cognitive science</i>. I am particularly interested in the development of computational methods to improve the understanding of language production.

Furthemore, I am PhD candidate at the <a href='https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/klinisch_psychologische_intervention/'>Division of Clinical Psychological Intervention, FU Berlin</a> and write my dissertation on "Understanding Publication Bias Using Large Language Models and Behavioral Methods" using methods from machine learning, behavioral science and classical research synthesis.

I earned my M.Sc. in <i>Psychology</i> from the Uni Potsdam and my B.Sc. from the Uni Hamburg, specializing in clinical psychology, longitudinal data modeling and machine learning. Furthermore, I received a B.A. in <i>Sociology and Technology Studies</i>  with a minor in Human Factors Engineering from the TU Berlin.
