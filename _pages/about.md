I am a psychologist (MSc) and research associate at the <a href='https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/klinisch_psychologische_intervention/'>Division of Clinical Psychological Intervention, FU Berlin</a>. My research centers around <i>natural language processing</i>, <i>metascience</i>, and <i>psychotherapy research</i>. I am particularly interested in the development of machine learning methods to improve the estimation of <i>publication bias</i> in the scientific literature.

I am a member of the <a href='https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/commitments/research-quality/project-list-20/panne/index.html'>PANNE</a> project (HU & FU Berlin), led by <a href='https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/klinisch_psychologische_intervention/mitarbeiter/hniemeyer/index.html'>Dr. Helen Niemeyer</a> and <a href='https://www.rmz.hu-berlin.de/en/members/staff/dr-felicitas-hesselmann'>Dr. Felicitas He√üelmann</a>, which investigates publication bias in <i>psychological and historical research </i> using machine learning, behavioral and classical research synthesis methods.

I earned my M.Sc. in <i>Psychology</i> from the Uni Potsdam and my B.Sc. from the Uni Hamburg, specializing in clinical psychology, longitudinal data modeling and machine learning. Furthermore, I received a B.A. in <i>Sociology and Technology Studies</i>  with a minor in Human Factors Engineering from the TU Berlin.
