Word-association paradigms use exactly this logic—when a participant sees a cue (e.g., <em>dog</em>), the associations they produce or select (e.g., <em>cat</em>, <em>leash</em>, <em>bark</em>) are constrained by their underlying semantic organization. When such judgments are aggregated across trials, the resulting response statistics yield a similarity matrix that approximates the geometry of an otherwise unobserved semantic system.</p> <p>We transfer this measurement logic to large language models. Unlike humans, both behavior <em>and</em> internal representations are observable in LLMs. This creates a unique opportunity: we can systematically test how well an LLM’s behavioral output reveals its internal semantic geometry. A key open question is not only how model behavior compares to humans, but also what a model’s <em>own</em> behavior reveals about its <em>own</em> internal representations.</p> <div class="figure-container"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/neural_semantic_geometry/conceptual.pdf" alt="Conceptual overview of the framework" style="max-width: 100%;" class="zoomable" data-zoomable=""/> <div class="figure-caption">Conceptual overview. For a shared vocabulary, we (i) extract layer-wise word representations to form a hidden-state similarity matrix, and (ii) run behavioral association tasks (forced choice / free association) to build a behavioral similarity matrix. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) correlates the pairwise similarities to quantify behavior--activation alignment.</div> </div> <h2 id="framework-behavioral-paradigms-and-hidden-state-extraction">Framework: Behavioral paradigms and hidden-state extraction</h2> <h3 id="two-behavioral-paradigms">Two behavioral paradigms</h3> <p>We use two classic psycholinguistic paradigms—forced choice (FC) and free association (FA)—to collect semantic relations from model behavior over a shared vocabulary of 5,000 high-frequency English nouns <d-cite key="brysbaert2012adding"></d-cite>.</p> <div class="figure-container"> <img src="/assets/img/blog/neural_semantic_geometry/both_paradigms.pdf" alt="Forced choice and free association paradigms" style="max-width: 100%;" class="zoomable" data-zoomable=""/> <div class="figure-caption">Behavioral paradigms and derived semantic geometries. Left (forced choice): given a cue word and a candidate set, the model selects the most related words. Right (free association): given a cue word alone, the model generates multiple associates. From the resulting cue--response count matrices, we compute similarity matrices by cosine similarity between rows.</div> </div> <p>In the <strong>forced-choice</strong> paradigm, each cue word is presented together with 16 candidate words, from which the model must select exactly two words that are most semantically related to the cue. Candidate sets are constructed by a deterministic shuffle of the remaining vocabulary, yielding 313 FC trials per cue. In the <strong>free-association</strong> paradigm, the model is prompted with a single cue word and asked to generate exactly five single-word associates. This is repeated across 126 stochastic runs per cue.</p> <p>For each paradigm, model outputs are aggregated into a sparse cue–response count matrix $\mathbf{B}$. We reweight counts with positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) to reduce the influence of globally frequent responses, then compute a cue–cue similarity matrix via cosine similarity between the PPMI-weighted row vectors. In total, we collected over <strong>17.5 million trials</strong> across both paradigms and eight models.</p> <h3 id="hidden-state-extraction">Hidden-state extraction</h3> <p>For each model and each word, we extract layerwise hidden-state representations under four contextual embedding strategies:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Averaged</strong>: The target word embedded in 50 naturally occurring C4 sentences <d-cite key="raffel2020exploring"></d-cite>, with hidden states averaged across contexts <d-cite key="bommasani2020interpreting"></d-cite>.</li> <li><strong>Meaning</strong>: A fixed definition-style prompt (<em>“What is the meaning of the word {w}?”</em>).</li> <li><strong>Task (FC)</strong>: The target word embedded in the FC instruction prompt (without candidates).</li> <li><strong>Task (FA)</strong>: The target word embedded in the FA instruction prompt.</li> </ul> <p>Hidden-state similarity matrices are computed as cosine similarity between mean-centered layerwise word vectors <d-cite key="ethayarajh2019contextual"></d-cite>.</p> <h3 id="models-and-baselines">Models and baselines</h3> <p>We evaluate eight instruction-tuned decoder-only transformer models ranging from 7B to 14B parameters (Falcon3, Gemma-2, Llama-3.1, Mistral-7B, Mistral-Nemo, Phi-4, Qwen2.5, and rnj-1). Beyond behavioral embeddings, we compare hidden-state similarities to three baselines: <strong>FastText</strong> (static word vectors) <d-cite key="bojanowski2017enriching"></d-cite>, <strong>BERT</strong> (contextual encoder) <d-cite key="devlin2019bert"></d-cite>, and a <strong>cross-model consensus</strong> geometry aggregating hidden-state similarities across all other models—motivated by recent evidence for a shared semantic subspace across diverse LLMs <d-cite key="huh2024platonic"></d-cite>.</p> <h3 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h3> <p>We use three complementary evaluation methods:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)</strong> <d-cite key="kriegeskorte2008representational"></d-cite> <d-cite key="nili2014toolbox"></d-cite>: For each layer, we vectorize the upper-triangular entries of the hidden-state and reference similarity matrices and compute their Pearson correlation.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Nearest-neighbor overlap</strong> ($\mathrm{NN@}k$): We quantify how well the $k$-nearest-neighbor neighborhoods induced by hidden-state similarity match those of the reference spaces.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Held-out-words ridge regression</strong>: We test whether behavioral similarity predicts unseen hidden-state similarities on held-out words beyond lexical baselines and cross-model consensus.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="results">Results</h2> <h3 id="forced-choice-aligns-substantially-more-than-free-association">Forced choice aligns substantially more than free association</h3> <p>Across all models and evaluation methods, FC behavior aligns substantially more strongly with hidden-state geometry than FA.

This has implications for both interpretability research and cognitive science:</p> <p><strong>For interpretability</strong>: Behavioral probing can serve as a practical tool for understanding internal representations when only black-box access is available. The FC paradigm’s controlled candidate sets concentrate observations and produce a less sparse cue–response matrix, yielding higher signal-to-noise measurements of semantic geometry <d-cite key="roads2021enriching"></d-cite>.</p> <p><strong>For cognitive science</strong>: Using our fully observable language-model setup, we can subject a core assumption to rigorous empirical tests—that structured behavior is constrained by, and can therefore partially reveal, internal states. The finding that measurement protocol strongly determines recoverability (FC vs. FA) suggests that whether a behavioral task <em>reveals</em> internal structure is not a generic property of “behavior”: it depends critically on how responses are constrained and aggregated.</p> <p><strong>Cross-model consensus</strong>: A striking finding is the strength of cross-model consensus—similarity structure shared across other LLMs explains a large fraction of variance in a target model’s hidden-state geometry, consistent with the hypothesis of a substantial common semantic subspace <d-cite key="huh2024platonic"></d-cite>.</p> <p>If you find this interesting and if this work is helpful for your research, please consider citing our paper:</p> <div class="language-bibtex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">@misc</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">schiekiera2026associations</span><span class="p">,</span>
