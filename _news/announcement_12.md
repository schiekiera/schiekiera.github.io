I had the chance to present a **poster** at **ESCOP 2025**:  
*Modeling Lexical Competition in Language Production: A Computational Approach to the Swinging Lexical Network*.  

In this work, we implement the Swinging Lexical Network as a computational spreading-activation model to explore semantic priming and lexical competition in picture–word interference data.  

You can view the poster [here](https://github.com/schiekiera/talks/blob/main/pdfs/poster_cSLN_schiekiera_2025-08-17.pdf) and find the code [here](https://github.com/schiekiera/cSLN_ESCOP_2025).

Thanks to the organizers for a well-run conference and to everyone who stopped by to chat about the project.
