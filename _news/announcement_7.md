I am pleased to share that I have joined the Computational Modelling Lab in the Department of Psychology at Humboldt University of Berlin as a research associate, starting October 1, 2024 for three years.
  
Our project, funded by the DFG, focuses on developing a computational implementation of the *Swinging Lexical Network* model for language production. This model will integrate distributional semantic models (word embeddings) with spreading activation dynamics in networks to address conceptual-semantic processing during speech planning.
