Excited to share a new preprint asking how much of a system’s internal semantic structure can be recovered from behavior alone. Across eight LLMs and 17.5M+ trials, we compare free association and forced-choice tasks and find that forced choice recovers hidden-state semantic geometry far better. 

**Preprint:** [arXiv:2602.00628 (PDF)](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2602.00628).
