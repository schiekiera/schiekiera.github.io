Excited to share a new preprint on how well behavioral probes (free association vs. forced-choice) recover the internal semantic geometry of language models. Preprint: [arXiv:2602.00628 (PDF)](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2602.00628) and data: [llm-association-geometry on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/schiekiera/llm-association-geometry).
