I was delighted to have the opportunity to give a talk at the 4th German Psychotherapy Congress in Berlin last week. 

My talk was about a meta-scientific study on publication bias in psychology - with a focus on the frequency of positive results and the scientific productivity of research groups. The slides can be found [here](https://github.com/schiekiera/talks/blob/main/pdfs/presentation_DPK_2025_schiekiera_positive_results_in_clinical_psychology.pdf).

Many thanks to the organizers for the platform and to everyone who listened and thought along.
