  abstract = {This study addresses the gap in machine learning tools for publication bias research by evaluating the performance of SciBERT and random forest in classifying results in clinical psychology abstracts. Over 1,900 abstracts were annotated into two categories: ‘positive results only’ and ‘mixed or negative results’. Model performance was evaluated on three benchmarks. The best-performing model was utilized to analyze trends in over 20,000 psychotherapy study abstracts. Results: SciBERT outperformed all benchmarks and random forest in in-domain (accuracy: 0.86) and out-of-domain data (accuracy: 0.85-0.88). The trend analysis revealed non-significant effects of publication year on positive results for 1990-2005, but a significant decrease in positive results between 2005-2022. When examining the entire time-span, significant positive linear and negative quadratic effects were observed. Discussion: Machine learning could support future efforts to address publication bias by identifying negative results in large data sets. The fine-tuned SciBERT model was deployed for public use.}

  abstract = {Publication bias, favoring statistically significant or hypothesis-consistent findings, impedes the process of scientific knowledge production. However, questions remain about the mechanisms underlying publication bias, and work has focused on between-subjects designs rather than within-subjects experiments. This study employed a within-subject design based on Dual Process Theories to investigate selective publication and reception choices. Four online experiments presented 16 abstract vignettes to clinical psychology researchers with statistical significance and hypothesis-consistency as the treatment variables (n = 75 per experiment). Participants initially judged publication, reading, or citation likelihood, providing an intuitive evaluation. After this they rated the accompanying Feeling of Rightness (FOR), followed by a reconsidered judgment. Using multilevel models, we examined if intuitive judgments as well as changes between evaluations varied as functions of statistical significance and hypothesis-consistency. Statistically nonsignificant and hypothesis-inconsistent results were not (not / negatively) associated with publication, reading, and citation likelihoods. Changes in publication, reading, and citation likelihoods were <not> directly associated with statistically nonsignificant and hypothesis-inconsistent results. Furthermore, these associations were (not) mediated by FOR. Our results suggest that biased publication and reception choices are (not) prevalent during intuitive judgements. However, bias (does not decrease/ decreases) during reconsidered evaluations of initially biased publication and reception choices.}

  abstract = {Publication bias, i.e. selectively publishing only results that favor one’s hypothesis, can be seen as a form of questionable conduct in academia. Having an unbiased and complete scientific record is a precondition for the circulation of existing knowledge and the ensuing production of new knowledge. It is therefore crucial that results which meet the field-specific standards of research quality are published in their entirety. The causes of publication bias, however, are complex, combining individual factors on the level of researchers with more structural causes in the academic publishing system which currently produce incentives that favor some results, i.e. positive and significant results, over others. In order to better understand publication bias, our project aims at identifying field-specific causes and conditions of non-publication. We address the problem by comparing decision making in publication processes in the two fields of clinical psychology and contemporary history. While the former predominantly uses quantitative methods for hypothesis-testing and primarily produces journal articles with multiple authors, the latter predominantly works qualitatively and hermeneutically and values single-author book publications. Using qualitative interviews (n=21), we traced the accounts of individual researchers from different career stages around publication and reception. We focus on the question of where in their complex research and publication processes researchers assign responsibility for publication outcomes, and in how far they assume a moral accountability for their publications. Complementary to the interviews, our methods involve observing team meetings and colloquia, analyzing publication lists and running online experiments with researchers as subjects. Preliminary results suggest that despite great differences in how publishing markets in the two fields are organized, researchers apply similar strategies of placing unpopular results in less prestigious venues. On the one hand, this is reflected in psychologists’ journal selection decisions which are mainly guided by the aspiration to publish in high-impact journals, but carefully balanced against the chance of acceptance. In cases of negative results, researchers have lower expectations of acceptance and tend to submit to journals with lower impact factors. On the other hand, historians reported that publishers prefer publications that support existing expectations while being reluctant to accept analytical perspectives unpopular within the scholarly community or to publish politically sensitive research topics due to fears of reputational damage. Historians react by outsourcing those topics and approaches to journals which are generally considered less important venues than book publishers. Additionally, invited publications are very common in the field of history, i.e. books and book chapters often result from networking and personal contacts. This makes it especially hard for early career researchers to gain access to publishers, intensifies the dependence of doctoral students from their supervisors and encourages the displacement of unpopular research approaches. In conclusion, this presentation sheds light on challenges, barriers and biases resulting from established power saturated research practices. It illustrates that publication is a highly complex process with distributed agency, rather than the clear responsibility of specific individual researchers. We invite participants to reflect on what this distributed agency might mean for moral accountability for contested research practices in different research fields.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Recent research demonstrated that fear of progression (FoP) is a major burden for adult cancer survivors. However, knowledge on FoP in parents of childhood cancer survivors is scarce. This study aimed to determine the proportion of parents who show dysfunctional levels of FoP, to investigate gender differences, and to examine factors associated with FoP in mothers and fathers.  Methods: Five hundred sixteen parents of pediatric cancer survivors (aged 0–17 years at diagnosis of leukemia or central nervous system (CNS) tumor) were consecutively recruited after the end of intensive cancer treatment. We conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses for mothers and fathers and integrated parent-, patient-, and family-related factors in the models.  Results: Significantly more mothers (54%) than fathers (41%) suffered from dysfunctional levels of FoP. Maternal FoP was significantly associated with depression, a medical coping style, a child diagnosed with a CNS tumor in comparison to leukemia, and lower family functioning (adjusted R2 = .30, p < .001). Paternal FoP was significantly associated with a lower level of education, depression, a family coping style, a child diagnosed with a CNS tumor in comparison to leukemia, and fewer siblings (adjusted R2 = .48, p < .001).  Conclusions: FoP represents a great burden for parents of pediatric cancer survivors. We identified associated factors of parental FoP. Some of these factors can be targeted by health care professionals within psychosocial interventions and others can provide an indication for an increased risk for higher levels of FoP.  Implications for Cancer Survivors: Psychosocial support targeting FoP in parents of childhood cancer survivors is highly indicated.}
